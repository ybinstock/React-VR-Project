# React-VR-Project

Issues

Clone to the desktop, npm start, and on http:/localhost:8081/vr/, you should see the app.

1. There's a video in the scene (behind the camera), I'm trying to figure out a way to load it so that it loads smoother, but can't find a way. Any suggestions? I've already compressed the video and 360 scene images.

2. I'm not sure why the isn't cursor showing up. In my client.js I have "cusorVisibility: 'visible',"

3. Obviously, I don't want those long rectangle text blocks in my current scene. I have tried everything with alignment, width, etc, but every time I make a change the height of the three 3 text boxes and the video get really screwed up and they no longer are on the same line. I have no idea what's causing this and how to set the width for them to act more like columns than rows.

4. Last question, if you look straight and down there's a next button that I would like to go the next scene.

When clicked it, I get a "_this2.Linking is undefined", but I can't find that anywhere in the code. And instead of www.google.com (line 111), I'd like for it to go to another js file to move to the next scene.
